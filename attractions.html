                    <h2>Taipei 101</h2>
                    <p>
                        The Taipei 101 formerly known as the Taipei World
                        Financial Center, is a supertall skyscraper designed by
                        C.Y. Lee and C.P. Wang in Xinyi, Taipei, Taiwan. This
                        building was officially classified as the world's
                        tallest from its opening in 2004 until the 2010
                        completion of the Burj Khalifa in Dubai, UAE. Its
                        elevators, capable of traveling 60.6 km/h (37.7 mph) and
                        used to transport passengers from the 5th to 89th floor
                        in 37 seconds, set new records upon completion.] In 2011
                        Taipei 101 received a Platinum rating under the LEED
                        certification system to become the tallest and largest
                        green building in the world. The structure regularly
                        appears as an icon of Taipei in international media, and
                        the Taipei 101 fireworks displays are a regular feature
                        of New Year's Eve broadcasts. Taipei 101's postmodernist
                        architectural style evokes traditional Asian aesthetics
                        in a modern structure employing industrial materials.
                        Its design incorporates a number of features that enable
                        the structure to withstand the Pacific Ring of Fire's
                        earthquakes and the region's tropical storms. The tower
                        houses offices and restaurants as well as both indoor
                        and outdoor observatories. The tower is adjoined by a
                        multilevel shopping mall that has the world's largest
                        ruyi symbol as an exterior feature. Taipei 101 is owned
                        by Taipei Financial Center Corporation. The skyscraper
                        opened on 31 December 2004 to celebrate New Year's Eve.

                    <h2>Shilin Nightmarket</h2>
                    <p>
                        The night market encompasses two distinct sections
                        sharing a symbiotic relationship: a section formerly
                        housed in the old Shilin Market building, containing
                        mostly food vendors and small restaurants; and the
                        surrounding businesses and shops selling other nonfood
                        items. The food court holds 539 stalls, and the second
                        floor serves as a parking lot for 400 cars. In addition
                        to the food court, side streets and alleys are lined
                        with storefronts and roadside stands. Cinemas, video
                        arcades, and karaoke bars are also prevalent in the
                        area. Like most night markets in Taiwan, the local
                        businesses and vendors begin opening around 16:00. As
                        students begin returning home from school, crowds reach
                        their peak between 20:00 and 23:00. Businesses continue
                        operating well past midnight, closing around 01:00 or
                        02:00. Tourist traffic has increased in recent years due
                        to the opening of the Taipei Metro system. The night
                        market is closest to Jiantan Station on Tamsui–Xinyi
                        line (Tamsui/Red Line), and can be seen from the station
                        platform.

                    <h2>Jiufen</h2>
                    <p>
                        Until the 1950's, Jiufen was a prosperous gold mining
                        town. The town went into sharp decline when mining was
                        discontinued. The quaint streets, tea houses and
                        stunning views of the Pacific Ocean saved it from
                        becoming yet another anonymous mining ghost town. Jiufen
                        is now a popular tourist destination for Taipeites eager
                        to relive scenes from the past. It has provided the
                        setting for several period movies. For example, Hou
                        Hsiao-hsien's film A City of Sadness (which won the
                        Golden Lion award at the 1989 Venice Film Festival) and
                        Studio Ghibli's Spirited Away. The town of Jiufen is
                        built into the side of the hills slightly inland from
                        the Pacific Ocean coastline. The main area of interest
                        to visitors are the town's historic commercial district
                        which is covered by two pedestrian streets: Jishan
                        Street (基山街, which runs along the ridge line), and
                        Shuchi (Shuqi) Street (豎崎路, which runs up and down
                        the slope of the hill). The area is small enough to
                        cover on foot.

                    <p>
                        Kenting National Park commonly known as Kenting is a
                        national park located on the Hengchun Peninsula of
                        Pingtung County, Taiwan, covering Hengchun, Checheng,
                        and Manzhou Townships. Established on 1 January 1984, it
                        is Taiwan's oldest and the southernmost national park on
                        the main island, covering the southernmost area of the
                        Taiwan island along Bashi Channel. Administered by the
                        Executive Yuan's Ministry of the Interior, this national
                        park is well known for its tropical climate and

                        rock-band festival held in every March, and has long

                    <h2>Puli</h2>
                    <p>
                        Puli was severely damaged in the 1999 earthquake, and
                        although the town has since been rebuilt, there is
                        little in the way of actual tourist attractions.
                        However, the town is located in a very lush and
                        beautiful valley with many hiking trails, and its
                        central position makes it a logical base for visiting
                        the mountains and lakes in the area. Puli is famous for
                        its four 'W's - water, wine, women and weather. Being
                        located in a pristine mountain area, the local spring
                        water is pure and sweet and sold in bottles at
                        supermarkets around the island. The abundance of fresh,
                        clean water lent itself to the production of wine - the
                        second 'W' - while the exceptionally fine complexions of
                        the town's women folk, which some theorize is the result
                        of the local water, constitutes the third 'W'. Finally,
                        the fourth 'W' refers to Puli's ideal climate, which is
                        characterized by short and relatively dry winters and
                        cool summers. Possibly as a result of the mild climate,
                        the town has developed into a center for Buddhism. There
                        are large monasteries scattered throughout the valley,
                        while the mountain-sides provide havens for retreat
                        centers and hermitages.

                        spelling of the district is Peitou. The name originates
                        from the Ketagalan word Kipatauw, meaning witch. Beitou
                        is the most mountainous and highest of Taipei's
                        districts, encompassing a meadow with rivers running
                        through the valley which have abundant steam rising from
                        them; the result of geothermal warming. The valley is
                        often surrounded by mist shrouding the trees and grass.
                        Beitou is famous for its hot springs.[1] In March 2012,
                        it was named one of the Top 10 Small Tourist Towns by
                        the Tourism Bureau of Taiwan.

                        Yehliu is a cape in Wanli District, New Taipei, Taiwan.
                        The cape, known by geologists as the Yehliu Promontory,
                        forms part of the Daliao Miocene Formation. It stretches
                        approximately 1,700 metres into the ocean and was formed
                        as geological forces pushed the Datun Mountains out of
                        the sea. A distinctive feature of the cape is the hoodoo
                        stones that dot its surface. These shapes can be viewed
                        at the Yehliu Geopark operated by the North Coast and
                        Guanyinshan National Scenic Area administration. A
                        number of rock formations have been given imaginative
                        names based on their shapes. The best known is the
                        "Queen's Head", an iconic image in Taiwan and an
                        unofficial emblem for the town of Wanli. Other
                        formations include the "Fairy Shoe", the "Beehive", the
                        "Ginger Rocks", and the "Sea Candles".
